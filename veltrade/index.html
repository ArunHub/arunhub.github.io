                    <h2>What is Forex?</h2>
                    <p><img src="images/home-1.png" alt="" />Forex, also known as foreign exchange, FX or currency trading, is a decentralized global market where all the world's currencies trade. The forex market is the largest, most liquid market in the world with an average daily trading volume exceeding $5 trillion. All the world's combined stock markets don't even come close to this. But what does that mean to you? Take a closer look at forex trading and you may find some exciting trading opportunities unavailable with other investments.</p>
                    <p>the forex exchange rate between the two currencies—based on supply and demand—determines how many euros you get for your pounds. And the exchange rate fluctuates continuously.</p>
                    <p>Currencies exchange is the primary reason why the forex market is the largest, most liquid financial market in the world. It dwarfs other markets in size, even the stock market, with an average traded value of around U.S. $2,000 billion per day.The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) reported that the forex market traded in excess of U.S. $4.9 trillion per day.)</p>
                    <h3>Is Forex a Gambling?</h3>
                    <p class="strong"><img class="angrybull" src="images/home-2.png" alt="" />NO---Forex is not gambling.</p>
                    <p>we are now seeing this that many traders are comparing forex with gambling but i want to tell them that gambling and trading is different.Gambling is a fun thing and many people gamble to enjoy but forex trading business is not like gambling.Forex trading business is an international business and many people lead there life by working on Forex trading business also this business has been submitted by religion so do not compare Forex trading with gambling. </p>
                    <p>gambling is quite different from Investment trading, irrespectively, once you bet you have no option for saving money in opposite results. Forex runs over market analysis and its technical interpretation, similarity is minor, both have two options like head and tell, here you see buy and sell, but all fenomenon goes through probable market behavior, forex market pertains to global macro economies and finential institutions and banks have major roles in bullish and bearish behavior of prices, in casino, only players perform through gambling tools and get final results in mean time, but here we have time to analysis for broad anaysis which is certainly not like final results and have side retrachments time to time. Betting is out of side action, we have choices for changing actions and actions wholly comprise subsidiary movement. It's safe side and risk recovering point in forex.</p>
                    <p>Forex trading is a business that is needed in the development of self-control skills, money management skills and analytical skills.</p>

                            <h4>Forex Risk Disclaimer</h4>
                            <p>Trading foreign exchange on margin carries a high level of risk, and may not be suitable for all investors. Past performance is not indicative of future results. The high degree of leverage can work against you as well as for you. Before deciding to invest in foreign exchange you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or all of your initial investment and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated with foreign exchange trading, and seek advice from an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts. No representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profits or losses similar to those that may be shown. Past performance is not indicative of future results. Individual results vary and no representation is made that clients will or are likely to achieve profits or incur losses comparable to those that may be shown. Past performance is not indicative of future results. You acknowledge and agree that no promise or guarantee of success or profitability has been made between you and www.veltrade.com.</p>
                            <h4>Risks Associated with Trading Forex</h4>
                            <p>Trading foreign currencies can be a challenging and potentially profitable opportunity for investors. However, before deciding to participate in the Forex market, you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. Most importantly, do not invest money you cannot afford to lose. There is considerable exposure to risk in any foreign exchange transaction. Any transaction involving currencies involves risks including, but not limited to, the potential for changing political and/or economic conditions that may substantially affect the price or liquidity of a currency. Investments in foreign exchange speculation may also be susceptible to sharp rises and falls as the relevant market values fluctuate. The leveraged nature of Forex trading means that any market movement will have an equally proportional effect on your deposited funds. This may work against you as well as for you. Not only may investors get back less than they invested, but in the case of higher risk strategies, investors may lose the entirety of their investment. It is for this reason that when speculating in such markets it is advisable to use only risk capital.</p>
